🔍 Exploring Retail Sales with EDA

Excited to share my latest project where I explored Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on retail sales data! 📊 Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I uncovered valuable insights into customer spending patterns, product performance, and demographic trends.
🚀 Key Highlights:
Identified Electronics as a top-performing category and explored gender-wise spending trends.
Analyzed age-based purchasing behavior to refine customer targeting strategies.
Visualized data effectively with advanced charts for clear insights.
This project strengthened my technical expertise and reinforced the importance of data-driven decisions in retail sales.
